Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

from collections import Counter
def majorityElement(nums):
        k = len(nums)//2
        count = Counter(nums)
        for i in nums:
            if count[i]>k:
                return i
